Uses the pc and effective address (associated with the load op whose value we seek to 
predict), previous 4 load values, and the previous 2 store values to predict the load
value. Each of the previous 64 bit values are split into two 32 bit values and are 
used to predict the two 32bit values which comprise the load value.

/*************/
Uses the pc and  effective address (associated with the load op whose value we seek to 
predict), effective address and the values of the previous 4 loads, along
with the effective address and the values of the previous 2 store values to
predict the load value. Each 64 bit value is split into two 32 bit values.

/*************/
Uses the pc and  effective address (associated with the load op whose value we seek to 
predict), the pc and effective address and the values of the previous 4 loads, along
with the pc and effective address and the values of the previous 2 store values to
predict the load value. Each 64 bit value is split into four 16 bit values.
